								<p><center><img src="images/dj2.jpg" width="300" alt="" /></center></p>
								<p>I am an oceanographer at the <a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/">British Antarctic Survey</a> and a Senior Member of <a href="https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/">Darwin College</a>, University of Cambridge.
								<p>I entered oceanography via physics and applied mathematics. My typical regions of study are the Southern Ocean and (recently) the North Atlantic, which are both 
								climate-relevant regions that feature strong exchanges of heat and carbon between the atmosphere and the deep ocean. My toolbox includes a hierarchy of approaches, from simple pen-and-paper representations to high-resolution adjoint models. 
								
								<p>Outside of work, I spend time with my wife and young son, squeezing in some reading and guitar playing where possible. 
								We live in a village just outside of Cambridge, UK.</p>

								<p><h3 class="minor">Background</h3>
							
								Earth's oceans have an enormous impact on global and regional climate. For example, the ocean contains more than <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051106">90% of the extra heat</a> present in the climate system due 
								to global warming. However, the mechanisms involved in the exchange of heat and carbon between the ocean and atmosphere, and how they may change in the future, are still poorly understood.
								
								</p>
					
								<p>At a few distinct locations on Earth, the natural injection of heat and carbon into the interior ocean, called <i>subduction</i>, is particularly intense.  
								Once trapped in the interior ocean, the subducted heat and carbon can remain there for decades to centuries, potentially slowing global surface warming. 
								These atmosphere-ocean exchange windows are typically found in the <b>Southern Ocean</b> and the high-latitude <b>North Atlantic</b>, which feature exceptionally deep mixing between the surface and the interior ocean. 
								For example, the Eastern Pacific pathway (shown below) is a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016JC011680"><b>relatively rapid and efficient export pathway (link to research article)</b></a> for the exchange of water between the surface and the subtropical interior.
								In order to understand and predict future climate change, <b>we have to understand what controls the location and intensity of these relatively narrow exchange windows.</b></p>

								<hr>
								
								<p><h3 class="minor">Ocean circulation, dynamics, and climate</h3></p>

								I use a combination of basic physics, mathematics, and numerical modeling to better understand the behavior of the ocean, including its sensitivity 
								to other components of the climate system. For example, I use <b>ocean adjoint models</b> to uncover potentially hidden ways in which the ocean 
								can respond to changes in the atmosphere. In a recent study, <b>we found that the heat content of the Labrador Sea, a region of deep convection in the 
								North Atlantic, is sensitive to wind stress along the relatively remote West African shelf</b>. This kind of large-scale, remote connection is an important feature 
								of the climate system that we need to better understand. For more information, including an introduction to adjoint sensitivity experiments, see our 
								<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2018JC013774"><b>article in JGR-Oceans</b></a>, which is also available 
								as an <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/kc2u9">open access preprint</a>. 
								The study is also summarized in this <a href="http://acsis.ac.uk/articles/item/23-what-controls-the-climatically-important-heat-content-of-the-labrador-seathis"> <b>plain language blog post</b></a></p>

								<hr>
								
								<p><h3 class="minor">Machine learning: clustering</h3>

								I have recently started applying various <b>unsupervised clustering algorithms</b> to oceanographic data in order to better understand its structure. 
								In particular, my students and I have applied Gaussian mixture modelling, a machine learning technique, to Southern Ocean temperature profiles. 
								Our initial results are promising, as we describe in <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/m64t7"><b>this preprint</b></a> (in revision for JGR-Oceans). Clustering 
								may offer a new, objective way to identify structures in both observed and simulated climate data, ultimately enhancing our ability to understand the climate system.</p>

								<p><h3 class="minor">Air-sea gas exchange</h3>
								
								The exchange of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and other gases at the air-sea interface has an enormous impact on surface climate across a wide range of timescales. 
								Despite its critical importance to the climate system, the sensitivity of gas exchange to winds, biogeochemical parameters, and other factors remains poorly understood. 
								Using simple analysing and modeling techniques, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GB004813">we developed a simple model of air-sea gas exchange efficiency</a> to 
								help understand the large-scale, persistent disequilibrium of carbon dixodie between the atmosphere and ocean.</p>

								<p><h3 class="minor">Linking physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology</h3>
								
								Ocean circulation connects geographically distinct ecosystems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales via exchanges of physical properties and biogeochemical tracers. 
								Non-local processes can be especially important for ecosystems in the Southern Ocean, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transports propertie across ocean basins through 
								both advection and mixing. In collaboration with ecologists, I use physical, biogeochemical, and ecological data to better understand what sets the location of top predator habitats (work in revision). </p>
